# Hi, I’m Atharva Pore 👋

I’m an **AI Engineer and graduate student in Artificial Intelligence** with a passion for building **scalable, real-world AI systems**. My background combines **machine learning, data engineering, and software development**, with experience spanning academic research and industry applications.

I enjoy working on problems at the intersection of **Generative AI, deep learning, and intelligent multi-agent systems** — always aiming to design solutions that are not only technically robust but also impactful in practical settings.

I’m currently pursuing my **Master’s in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Michigan, Dearborn** (GPA 4.0/4.0) and have prior industry and research experience in areas like **data pipelines, ML model optimization, and AI integration**.

Outside of academics and work, I’m deeply interested in **open-source collaboration, applied AI projects, and continuous learning** — whether that’s experimenting with new frameworks, reading research, or contributing to technology communities.
